# L-JA_Characterization
# Code built and maintained by Noah Stern (University of Texas at Austin, Biomedical Engineering) under advisement of Dr. Tyrone Porter (DEAL Group).

# Code represents the basic files written to load, read, and analyze files obtained from the VEVO F2/LAZR-X system by VisualSonics/FUJIFILM. This repository is meant to demonstrate possible ways to analyze Photoacoustic data, but to run the code itself, proprietary parsing and read functions built by VisualSonics are required. These are indicated in the code whenever "VSI_" is incorporated into a function call, but are not included in this repository for licensing reasons. Please contact VisualSonics for more info on purchasing/obtaining these files. 
# Typically, the "Show" files call all necessary functions required to analyze exported data from the F2, before going through any potential analysis. Included here are the general methods used for tracking a single wavelength, a full spectral scan, monitroing photostability, and analyzing in vivo data.
